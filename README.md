## Technologies

This is a Python 3.8 project ran in Google Colab but can be used in JupyterLab using a Conda dev environment. 

The following dependencies are used: 
1. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - Running code 
2. [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) (4.13.0) - Dev environment
3. [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) (1.3.5) - Data analysis
4. [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) (3.5.1) - Data visualization
5. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) (1.21.5) - Data calculations + Pandas support
6. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) (1.1.3) - Machine learning tools and methods

## Installation Guide

If you would like to run the program in JupyterLab, install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distribution and run `jupyter lab` in a conda dev environment.

To ensure that your notebook runs properly you can use the [requirements.txt](/Resources/requirements.txt) file to create an exact copy of the conda dev environment used in development of this project. 

Create a copy of the conda dev environment with `conda create --name myenv --file requirements.txt`

Then install the requirements with `conda install --name myenv --file requirements.txt`
